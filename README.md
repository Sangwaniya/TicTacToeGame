# TicTacToeGame

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using Java Only. The game allows two players (X & O) to play against each other on the same screen.

To start the game, simply run the [main file/run command]. The game board is displayed on the screen, and each player can take turns placing their symbol (X or O) on the board until someone wins or the board is filled.

The game includes error handling to prevent invalid moves and checks for a win or tie condition after each move. The winner is declared when a player has three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.

The code is well-documented. Feel free to modify the code and add new features to make the game even more exciting.
